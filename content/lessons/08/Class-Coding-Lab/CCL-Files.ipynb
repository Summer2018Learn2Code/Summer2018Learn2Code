    "For this lab, we will write a program to read spam confidence headers from a mailbox file like `ICCL-mbox-tiny.txt` or `ICCL-mbox-small.txt`. These files contain raw email data, and in that data is a SPAM confidence number for each message:\n",

    "Our goal will be to find each of these lines in the file, and extract the confidence number (In this case `0.8475`), with the end-goal of calculating the average SPAM Confidence of all the emails in the file. \n",
